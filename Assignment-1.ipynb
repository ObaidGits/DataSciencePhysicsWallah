    "##### 1. Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is popular for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Python has a simple, clean syntax that makes it easy to learn and use, even for beginners.\n",
    "Versatility: It supports multiple programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "Extensive Libraries: Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Django) for tasks ranging from web development to data analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "Cross-Platform: Python runs on various operating systems, making it highly portable.\n",
    "Community Support: A large and active community provides extensive resources, documentation, and tools for developers.\n",
    "These features contribute to Python's widespread use in fields like data science, web development, automation, and more."

    "##### 2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program\n",
    "Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes. They cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. These keywords define the syntax and structure of Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role of Predefined Keywords:\n",
    "Control flow: Keywords like if, else, while, and for control the flow of a program.\n",
    "Data types: Keywords like True, False, and None define Boolean and null values.\n",
    "Functionality: Keywords like def, return, and lambda are used to define and return functions.\n",
    "Error handling: Keywords like try, except, and finally are used for exception handling.\n",

    "Mutability: Mutable objects can be altered in place, while immutable objects require creating a new object for changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python has several types of operators used for performing operations on variables and values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arithmetic Operators:\n",
    "Used for mathematical calculations.\n",
    "+ (Addition), - (Subtraction), * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus)\n",
    "###### Code Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> a, b = 5, 3\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(a + b)  # Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(a % b)  # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Comparison Operators:\n",
    "Compare two values, returning True or False.\n",
    "== (Equal), != (Not equal), <, >, <=, >=\n",
    "###### Code Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(5 == 3)  # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    ">print(5 > 3)   # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logical Operators:\n",
    "Used to combine conditional statements.\n",
    "and, or, not\n",
    "###### Code Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(True and False)  # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(not True)        # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Assignment Operators:\n",
    "Used to assign values to variables.\n",
    "=, +=, -=, *=, /=\n",
    "###### Code Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "> x += 5   # Equivalent to x = x + 5\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(x) # Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Bitwise Operators:\n",
    "Work on bits and perform bit-level operations.\n",
    "& (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), << (left shift), >> (right shift)\n",

    "##### 5) Explain the concept of type casting in python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type casting in Python refers to converting one data type into another. It allows developers to change the data type of a variable or value to match the desired format in a particular context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Type Casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit Type Casting (Automatic):\n",
    "Python automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger data type during operations to avoid data loss.\n",
    "###### Example Code Below:\n",
    "> num_int = 5       # Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "> num_float = 3.5   # Float\n",
    "\n",
    "> result = num_int + num_float  # int is implicitly converted to float\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(result)  # Output: 8.5 (float)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit Type Casting (Manual):\n",
    "Developers manually convert one data type into another using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
    "###### Example Code Below:\n",
    "###### Integer to String\n",
    "> num = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "> num_str = str(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(num_str)  # Output: '10' (string)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Example Code Below:\n",
    "###### Float to Integer\n",
    "> num_float = 5.67\n",
    "\n",
    "> num_int = int(num_float)  # Truncates the decimal part\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(num_int)  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Common Type Casting Functions:\n",
    "> int(): Converts to integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> float(): Converts to float.\n",
    "\n",
    "> str(): Converts to string.\n",
    "\n",
    "> st(), tuple(), set(): Convert to list, tuple, or set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Type casting ensures compatibility and flexibility in operations involving different data types."

    "##### 6) How do Conditional Statements work in Python ? Illustrate with Examples.\n",
    "```\n",

    "Types of Conditional Statements:\n",
    "if Statement: Executes the block if the condition is True.\n",

    "    # Executes if the previous condition is False and this one is True\n",
